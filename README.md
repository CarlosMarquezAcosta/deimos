# Deimos

A basic Text Editor built with I wanted to make, it was built with Dear PyGUI.
    Currently it only: edits, saves and open files

# Requirements

    Python:
        Libraries:
            dearpygui 2.0.0
            screeninfo

# TODO

There are still many changes I want to work on, such as changing text size, right now from my understanding the current library of dearpygui does not support syntax highlihging which I will have to figure out.

1.Text Change
2. Save Current File
3. Shortcuts

# Regret

I made the decision for this UI library due to running arch linux on my laptop and did not want to figure out qt working here, I will try on a desktop device and see how it will be.
